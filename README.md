# Simple Shell

Release date December 22, 2023

# Introduction

What is Shell?

A shell is a command-line interpreter, it is the computer program that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system. Depending on the type of interface they use, shells can be of various types, in this case, a shell program of the type sh (Bourne Shell) will be developed. Users typically interact with a shell using a terminal emulator that is used for entering data into and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system.

What is it for?

This consists of interpreting orders. It incorporates features such as process control, input/output redirection, law listing and reading, protection, communications, and a command language for writing batch programs or scripts. All Unix-type systems have at least one interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell. The Bourne shell program is found within the Unix file hierarchy at /bin/sh.
